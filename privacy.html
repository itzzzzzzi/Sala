            This website collects information and accredited images exclusively through submissions sent via email or through independent research, always with the aim of providing proper accreditation. If any work is not correctly credited, please notify us via email.

        <p>
            By submitting your work, you agree that the information and images you provide may be published following a curated selection process. We do not share your personal data with third parties.

            Sala uses Netlify and GitHub as sustainable hosting services powered by renewable energy. Each image goes through a process of sustainable translation to minimize its environmental footprint. This allows the project to maintain a minimetric impact while preserving the quality of the artworks.
